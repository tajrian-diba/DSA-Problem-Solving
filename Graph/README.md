## 🧠 Graph Representation

Graphs are commonly represented using:

- Adjacency Matrix
- Adjacency List (Efficient for sparse graphs)

This repository mainly uses **Adjacency List**.

## 🔍 Graph Traversal

### ✅ DFS (Depth First Search)
- Uses Recursion / Stack
- Explores deeply before backtracking
- Time Complexity: O(V + E)

### ✅ BFS (Breadth First Search)
- Uses Queue
- Explores level by level
- Time Complexity: O(V + E)

## ⏱️ Complexity Overview

| Algorithm | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|------------|-----------------|------------------|
| DFS        | O(V + E)       | O(V)             |
| BFS        | O(V + E)       | O(V)             |

Where:
- V = Number of Vertices
- E = Number of Edges
