## 🧩 What is Dynamic Programming?

Dynamic Programming is an optimization technique used to solve problems by:

1. Breaking them into smaller subproblems
2. Storing the results of already solved subproblems
3. Avoiding repeated computation

---

## 🔑 Key Concepts

- Overlapping Subproblems
- Optimal Substructure
- Memoization (Top-Down)
- Tabulation (Bottom-Up)

---

## 📊 Time Complexity Improvement

Example:

- Normal Fibonacci → O(2^n)
- DP Fibonacci → O(n)

---

## 🎯 Goal

To master optimization techniques and improve problem-solving efficiency for interviews and competitive programming.
