## ⏱️ Time Complexity Overview

| Algorithm       | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case |
|----------------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| Bubble Sort    | O(n)      | O(n²)        | O(n²)      |
| Selection Sort | O(n²)     | O(n²)        | O(n²)      |
| Insertion Sort | O(n)      | O(n²)        | O(n²)      |
| Merge Sort     | O(n log n)| O(n log n)   | O(n log n) |
| Quick Sort     | O(n log n)| O(n log n)   | O(n²)      |
| Heap Sort      | O(n log n)| O(n log n)   | O(n log n) |
